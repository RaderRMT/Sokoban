A quick sokoban made in Rust

## Building

Make sure `cargo` is installed. If it's installed, simply open a terminal/command prompt and enter `cargo build --release`.

You'll find the executable in `target/release/`.

To run it, make sure that the executable is in the same directory as the `levels` folder
